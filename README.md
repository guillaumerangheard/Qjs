# Q.js
Q.js is a tiny (as in 274B minified tiny), zero-dependency DOM selector library for IE9+ and modern browsers.
It is part of the [bla.js](https://github.com/guillaumerangheard/blajs) library, and is basically an `element.querySelector` and `element.querySelectorAll` wrapper.

The API is very simple: just call `Q(selector[,context]);` and *voil√†*.
